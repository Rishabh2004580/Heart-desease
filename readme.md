## Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning -IET Lucknow

According to World Health Organization statistics, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in
the world. CVDs were responsible for 32% of all global deaths in 2019, as estimated by the World Health
Organization. Heart attacks and strokes were responsible for 85% of these deaths. Low- and middle-income
countries account for more than three quarters of all CVD deaths.

Our final year project, done under the guidance of Dr. Pawan Kumar Tiwari and Ms. Pratibha Pandey .
We have created an web application and a prediction model based on machine learning using which a patient can fill basic details like age,gender,Chest Pain Types,Cholesterol Level etc.Based on that model is able to predict heart disease.We have used various machine learning algorithms eg.Logistic Regression,SVM,Decision Tree,Random Forest,KNN for prediction.User is also able to print the report for tracking the disease.

## installation

Make sure you have brew installed on your system. If not, follow the steps [here](https://brew.sh) to do so.

- Install Python 2.7 on your system.

  ```
    brew install python@2
  ```

- Update your path variables accordingly

  ```
    export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@2/libexec/bin:$PATH"
  ```

- Install flask on your system. This is essential for our libraries to work later.

```
 pip install Flask
```

- Install Visual Studio Code by following the steps given in flask.

- Clone the project (or copy the folder to your local)

  ```
    git clone https://github.com/Satish7897/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git
  ```

Now, the project is ready to run.

## Run Locally

After following the above steps for installation, type the command below to run the project.

```bash
  flask run
```

The project is running now.
